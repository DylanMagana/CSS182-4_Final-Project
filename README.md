## RF-DETR for Object Detection
This project explores the RF-DETR (Refined-Feature DETR) model for object detection. It involves building and evaluating an object detection model in Google Colab using a preprocessed and augmented dataset from Roboflow, visualizing predictions, and discussing the findings.

## Results
The RF-DETR model was trained over 10 epochs on the preprocessed and augmented dataset. Evaluation metrics showed an improving trend across training loss and performance metrics. The training loss decreased consistently, while validation loss plateaued, suggesting mild overfitting. The Average Precision @0.50 peaked at 0.52 for the model, while the mean Average Precision across IoU thresholds reached approximately 0.27. Average Recall hovered around 0.60 - 0.65, indicating moderate detection completeness. Inference results on sample test images show the model accurately identifying and labeling plastic, metal, and paper objects, though some labels exhibit low confidence.

Considering the training hyperparameters, the RF-DETR showed good performance. However, False Positive and False Negative detections are still made particularly for objects that are not common types of the classes. These errors were likely due to class imbalance and visual similarity between waste types under varied lighting and background conditions as well as little training and lack of further hyperparameter tuning. The validation loss curveâ€™s flat trajectory despite falling training loss suggests that generalization remains limited, and further hyperparameter tuning or more robust augmentations may be necessary.
